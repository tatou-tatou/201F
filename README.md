#201F
[Preview](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/201F/master/201F.png)

GTK2 from FlatStudioLight. GTK3 from Numix.

Don't use the gtk3 part (yes, it's that bad).

##TO-DO
### Gtk2
- Change how inactive text is displayed.
- Improve how PCManFM looks.
- Strange issues due to "contrast" and Murrine engine.

### Gtk3
- Everything.
